            "definition": "Hell is a word that originated from a Viking religion. The Teutonic Goddess of the Dead and the underworld was named [Hel], she was the daughter of Loki. Another “L” was added to her name, and for reasons unknown “Hell” came to be a word that would substitute several different ideas and places in the bible.\n\nHell should not be in the bible at all. Hell means whatever word the [translator] put Hell in place of in the [manuscript] they were rendering. Originally it substituted [Hades] and [Sheol], which is fine because they both mean the same thing, (the grave) only in two different languages. But Hell came to take on meanings derived from Greek mythology and other pagan ideas. Hell began to substitute other places that were completely different than Sheol and Hades, like [Gehenna] and [Tartarus]. But the definition of the word hell in most cultures is “to cover” or “to conceal.” (Which goes along with Sheol and Hades.)\n\nHell and [Hellfire] are deceptive words. When hell is used to indicate fire in the bible it is referring to Gehenna, a place of destruction, not a common grave of mankind, which Hades and Sheol both mean.\n\nThe Old English dialect spoke of “helling” potatoes. This did not mean to roast them in fire, but meant to put them in the ground.\n\nHell cannot be Gehenna, “the [unquenchable] fire” if it is also Hades, because “the Lake [of Fire]” is the same place that Jesus described as Gehenna, and Hades is going to be thrown into “the lake [of fire]” upon the [second death]. So most [bibles] indicate that “the Lake of Fire” is going to be thrown into “the Lake of Fire!” Revelation 20:14 Destruction into destruction? That doesn’t make any sense. The point of that scripture is that death and all that is bad, even the place of the dead, are going to be destroyed. So you can see the common inaccuracy and inconsistencies of the usage of Hell in the bible.\n\nHow can you rightly substitute four different words that have different meanings with one word, unless you intend on misleading people to believe that these four different places are the same place?",
